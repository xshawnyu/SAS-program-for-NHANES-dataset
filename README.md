#Introduction
##This study is aimed to examine the potential associations between thyroid disorder disease status of the participants and their exposure to two families of popular synthetic agents, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFOs) and phthalates. Both these synthetics have been widely used in man-made substances such as plastics (phthalates) and stain resistant materials (PFOs). 

#RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
##After controlling for major demographic covariates, is there a correlation between 1. blood concentration of PFOS and thyroid disorder? 2. urine concentration of phthalates and thyroid disease status?
